# Intelligences contract notes

Binding for later batches and the Verifier. One section per task.

## T1 - Single-transaction migration runner (MIG-05, AD-012)

- `Store.Migrate(ctx)` opens one write transaction, creates `schema_migrations` if missing,
  applies every embedded `*.sql` file not recorded there in name order, runs the file's Go hook
  right after it, records each version (`applied_at` = one timestamp for the run) and commits
  once. Any error rolls back every pending file and hook; a later `Migrate` retries from the
  same state.
- `store.Hook func(ctx context.Context, tx *sql.Tx) error`; `hooks map[string]Hook` keyed by
  version (file name without `.sql`). Hooks use raw SQL on `tx` only, never sqlc. A hook runs
  only when its file is pending.
- Errors: `migration <file>: …` (SQL), `migration <file> hook: …`, `record migration <file>: …`.
- Internal for tests: `(*Store).migrate(ctx, fsys fs.FS, hooks)` (files at the root of `fsys`),
  `migrationFiles(fsys)`, package var `migrations` (embedded files at the root). Test helpers:
  `applyMigration(ctx, name)` (one embedded file), `migrationsBefore(version)`, `snapshot(t, s)`
  (every schema object and row), `tableRows`, `versions`.

## T2 - Handle and default-name rules (PROF-02, AID-03)

Package `internal/handles` (leaf, no deps):

- `Kind`: `AI`, `User`, `Person` (default prefixes `ai`, `user`, `contact`).
- Constants: `MaxLen = 40`, `SlugLen = 36`, `MaxDisplayName = 64`.
- `Slug(s)`: lower-case, a fixed table folds common Latin letters with diacritics (á→a, ç→c,
  ñ→n, ü→u, ß→ss, æ→ae, œ→oe, ø→o …); every run of other characters (including any non-Latin
  rune) becomes one `-`; trimmed of `-`; cut to 36 bytes (then trimmed of `-` again).
- `Default(kind, base)`: `Slug(base)`; empty → `ai`/`user`/`contact`; starting with a non-letter →
  `ai-…`/`user-…`/`contact-…`.
- `Validate(h) (string, error)`: lower-cases, then `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,39}$`; reserved
  `partyline`, `all`, `everyone`, `here`, `owner`. Errors wrap `handles.ErrInvalid` (the message
  says why: shape or reserved). Returns the lower-cased handle.
- `Allocate(taken func(string) bool, base) string`: lower-cases `base` (a base not shaped like a
  handle becomes `Default(AI, base)`); returns `base` unless reserved or taken, else the first
  free `base-2`, `base-3`, …; a suffix that would pass 40 characters cuts the base
  (`xxx…x-1000`). `taken` receives lower-case candidates; callers make it case-insensitive.
- `DisplayName(base)`: drops control characters and invalid UTF-8, upper-cases the first rune,
  cuts to 64 code points (`discord` → `Discord`, `/` → `/`, `~` → `~`).

## T3 - Schema 0015 (PROF-01, MIG-01)

- `0015_intelligences.sql` has every table, column, index and trigger of the design's
  "Migration 0015 (schema)" verbatim: `intelligences`, `agents.folder` + `agents_folder`,
  `machines`, `people` + `people_alt`, `chat_people`, `chats.person_id`, `rooms.kind/dm_a/dm_b/
  read_baseline` + `rooms_dm_pair`, `read_cursors`, `messages.author_iid` +
  `messages_author_iid`, `connectors.operator_iid/account_label`, `users.notify_chat_id`,
  `outbox.purpose`, triggers `users_/agents_/people_intelligence_delete`.
- Upgrade data in the SQL part: `rooms.read_baseline = next_seq - 1` for existing rooms; new rooms
  default to 0.
- **Deviation (view):** `message_views` keeps the v0.3 project-member join `pm` as a transitional
  fallback, because v0.3 project code still creates project members until T16 (PROJ-07 tests).
  Agent author name order: room member display name, project member display name,
  `i` (author_iid), `ia` (the agent's own intelligence), `agents.display_name`, `auto_name`,
  `name`. User: `i`, `iu`, `users.display_name`, `username`. Chat: `i`, `sender_name`, chat title.
  System: `Partyline`. New columns `author_iid`, `author_handle`, `author_ikind`, `author_avatar`
  (from `i`, then `ia`/`iu`; '' when none). 0016 drops `pm`, `ia`, `iu`, `a`, `u`.
- Consequence for T7+: once an agent or user has an intelligence, the view prefers the
  intelligence's display name over `agents.display_name`/`auto_name`/`users.display_name`; any v0.3
  rename path still in use must also write `intelligences.display_name`.
- sqlc queries (CRUD only; later tasks may add more):
  - `intelligences.sql`: `CreateIntelligence`, `GetIntelligence`, `GetIntelligenceByHandle`,
    `CountIntelligenceHandle` (NOCASE), `ListIntelligencesByIDs` (`sqlc.slice('ids')`),
    `UpdateIntelligenceProfile` (display_name, handle, bio, updated_at), `SetIntelligenceAvatar`,
    `CountIntelligenceAvatar`, `DeleteIntelligence`.
  - `people.sql`: `CreatePerson`, `GetPerson`, `GetPersonByExternalID` (matches `external_id` or a
    non-empty `alt_external_id`, an external match first; returns
    `GetPersonByExternalIDRow{Person, Exact}`), `ListConnectorPeople`, `UpdatePersonSeen`
    (alt id, platform_name, last_seen_at), `SetPersonNameLocked`, `DeletePerson`,
    `UpsertChatPerson` (last_seen_at = MAX), `ListChatPeople`, `SetChatPerson`.
  - `machines.sql`: `UpsertMachine` (home, last_seen_at), `GetMachine`, `ListMachines`,
    `SetMachineLabel`, `DeleteMachine`.
  - `conversations.sql`: `CreateDMRoom` (caller passes sorted `dm_a < dm_b`), `GetDMRoom`,
    `SetRoomReadBaseline`, `UpsertReadCursor` (seq = MAX), `GetReadCursor`, `DeleteReadCursor`.
  - `SetConnectorOperator`, `SetConnectorAccountLabel`, `SetUserNotifyChat`,
    `CreateNotifyOutbox` (purpose `notify`), `SetMessageAuthorIID`, `SetAgentFolder`,
    `GetAgentByFolder` (folder <> '').
- Nothing writes `author_iid` on insert yet (T11), nothing creates intelligences for new users or
  agents yet (T7): rows created after the upgrade have none until then.

## T4 - Backfill (0015 hook) (MIG-01, MIG-04)

`store.hooks["0015_intelligences"] = backfillIntelligences` (`intelligences_backfill.go`):

- Handles are allocated in this order, each `handles.Allocate` against every handle already
  used: users (by `created_at`, then id) with `Default(User, username)`; agents (same order) with
  `Default(AI, name)`; people (by first sighting, connector, external id) with
  `Default(Person, name)`.
- Users: kind `human`, display = `users.display_name`, else `username`. Agents: kind `ai`,
  display = first non-empty of `display_name`, `auto_name`, `name`. Display names are copied as
  they are (no `DisplayName` normalisation) so v0.3 names survive. `created_at = updated_at =`
  the row's `created_at`. Every v0.3 agent keeps `folder = ''` (unlinked).
- People come from `identities` and chat messages with a `sender_id` (joined to their chat for
  the connector). Ids reported together (a sender id with its alt id) fold into one person per
  connector. `external_id` = the sender id of the person's latest message (the identity's
  external id when never seen in a message); `alt_external_id` = the latest different alt id,
  else another folded id, else ''. `platform_name` = latest non-empty sender name, else the
  identity's display. Display name = `platform_name`, else `"<Platform> contact"` (`WhatsApp`,
  `Telegram`, `Discord`, `Webhook`, else `DisplayName(kind)`). `created_at` = first sighting;
  `last_seen_at` = latest message time (NULL for identity-only people). Linked users' accounts
  get a person too (PEOP-02 links it to the user).
- `messages.author_iid`: `user`/`agent` → `author_id` (when that intelligence exists); `chat` with
  `author_user_id` → that user; `chat` with a sender id → the person; else ''.
- `chat_people`: every (chat, person) of a chat message with a sender id (linked senders
  included), `last_seen_at` = latest message time. `chats.person_id` for `kind = 'dm'` chats =
  the person of the chat's latest such message; other chats stay NULL.
- The sender author update is set-based through a temporary table (`backfill_senders`, dropped
  at the end): about 6 s for 200 000 messages on the loaded devbox.

## T5 - v0.3 projects (MIG-03)

SQL part of `0015_intelligences.sql`, before the view:

- For each `room_members` row of kind `project` whose project has agents: `INSERT OR IGNORE` an
  `agent` member for the project's agent ordered by `connected_at IS NULL, connected_at DESC,
  id` (the v0.3 active-session order), copying `outbound`, `added_by`, `created_at`,
  `display_name`, `sign_outbound`, `delivery`, `keywords_json`. An existing direct membership
  keeps its own settings. New member ids are random UUIDv4-shaped strings (as in 0011).
- `project_cursors` are copied to `agent_cursors` of that agent with `seq = MAX(existing, project)`.
- Then all project members, project grants and `projects` rows are deleted (`agents.project_id`
  → NULL by `ON DELETE SET NULL`; `project_cursors` cascade). The `projects` and
  `project_cursors` tables stay (empty) until 0016; v0.3 project code keeps compiling and working
  on new data until T16.
- **Deviation (test scope):** `TestAgentIdentityMigrationKeepsDataAndAcceptsProjects` (0011 data
  migration) now migrates to 0014 only (`migrationsBefore("0015")`), since 0015 removes the
  projects it asserts. Its assertions are unchanged. Helper type `olderThan{FS, version}` lists
  the files older than a version.

## T6 - v0.3 upgrade fixture and production route (MIG-01, MIG-05, GRP-01)

- `internal/store/testdata/v03_fixture.sql`: a v0.3 (schema 0014) data set with readable ids
  (`u-alice`, `a-atlas`, `r-inbox`, `k-tg`, `c-tgdm`, …): users (one disabled), sessions, tokens,
  invites, device requests and attempts, audit log, projects (Proj with three sessions incl. a
  never-connected one, Empty with none, Atlas), agents (fixed, temporary, archived), four rooms
  (ops with instructions, catch-all `inbox`, dev, bob's), members of every kind, grants of every
  kind, a telegram connector with catch-all `r-inbox` (scope dms) and a whatsapp connector,
  chats, an identity, auto-route skip, webhook replay, pairing code, messages of every author
  case, attachments, outbox rows (sent, pending, failed), agent and project cursors.
- `Store.MigrateBefore(ctx, version)` (exported): applies the embedded migrations older than
  `version` in one transaction (builds older-schema databases for upgrade tests).
- `testkit.WithDatabase(path)`: the app starts on a copy of that database (and its `-wal`) in the
  temp data dir; `app.Start` migrates it.
- Store tests (`intelligences_migration_test.go`): every v0.3 row and column survives except the
  project conversion's intended changes; rooms are groups with `read_baseline` = last seq; a hook
  failure after the real hook ran leaves `snapshot` identical and a later `Migrate` succeeds.
- **Deviation (forced failure):** the design's failure case (a pre-inserted intelligence row) is
  impossible before 0015 creates the table and `Allocate` never collides, so the test wraps the
  real hook and fails after it.
- API test (`upgrade_test.go`): a fake kind renamed `telegram` serves the fixture's connector.
  After the upgrade the agent `atlas` (v0.3 `X-Partyline-Agent: atlas`) gets the instructions
  notice of ops, a DM from the existing chat and from a new chat (catch-all) in `r-inbox`, and its
  reply goes out to chat `100`; the fixture's pending outbox row is sent too.
- Not covered here (later tasks): design test-plan item 6 (0016, T51) and the timeline's
  person name with platform badge (GRP-03, T11).
